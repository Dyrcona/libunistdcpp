# Design

Explain the design concepts. C++ wrapper for C POSIX and UNIX interfaces.

Targeting C++17 (and some C++20?) features that are supported by commonly
available compilers: GCC 11 and 12 as well as clang 13 and 14.

Incomplete coverage of POSIx.  Things that already exist in the C++
standard library, such as filesystems will be skipped.

## RAII

## Error Handling

Throw exceptions instead of return values.

## Simplicity
