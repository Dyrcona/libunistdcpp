# Design

Libunistcpp targets C++17 and commonly available compilers: GCC 11 and
12 as well as clang 13 and 14.

Incomplete coverage of the operating system and libraries.  Things
that already exist in the C++ standard library, such as filesystems
will be skipped.

## RAII

## Error Handling

Throw exceptions instead of return values.

## Simplicity
