## C++ Core Guidelines with exceptions

## Naming Conventions

Classes, structs, and enums begin with capital letter and written in studly caps.

Underscores used in the names of new function and variable names as
well as enum members.  Simple wrappers for existing functions and
types use the same format as the wrapped function.

## Class Declaration Order

## Open Brace Placement
